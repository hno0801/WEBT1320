                    <p> While having a relazing day at the beach you always want to have a nice fruity frink in your hand. Most prople prefer their drink with alcohol but they can be virgin drinks for the younger people. My favorite is also was margarita or a pina coloda.  </p>

                    <h2>Playing in the sand</h2>
                    <img src="images/sand.png" alt="sand toys">
                    <p> Everyone who goes to the beach has to experience playing in the sand and building sand castles at least once in their lifetime. Many of times when you go to a popular beach, you can wath sand castle competitions going on. Some people are truely unbelivable with the sculptures and castles they can build out of sand.  </p>

                    <img src="images/beach-ball.png" alt="beach ball">
                    <p> Another thing that is always fun to do when you are at the beach is to play beach games. Some of my favorites are beach volleyball, flying a kite, and many more.  </p>
